# Bioindicator Gas Leak Surveillance System

Arduino and Python code for the Bioindicator Gas Leak Surveillance System project.

## Overview
This project uses moss as a bioindicator to detect industrial gases. ESP32-CAM and sensors are integrated for real-time monitoring, with Python OpenCV analyzing color changes and Blynk IoT sending alerts.
