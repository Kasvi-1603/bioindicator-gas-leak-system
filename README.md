# Bioindicator Gas Leak Surveillance System

Arduino and Python code for the Bioindicator Gas Leak Surveillance System project.

## Overview
This project uses moss as a bioindicator to detect industrial gases. ESP32-CAM and sensors are integrated for real-time monitoring, with Python OpenCV analyzing color changes and Blynk IoT sending alerts.

## Repository Structure
- `arduino/` → Arduino and ESP32-CAM scripts  
- `python/` → Python OpenCV scripts for analysis and alerts  
- `media/` → Images and videos of the prototype  

Project accepted for presentation at CSITSS 2025.
